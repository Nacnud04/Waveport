This chapter contains routines for coordinate transformations, special functions and some miscellaneous but useful computations. Routines for special functions can be found elsewhere, however we give some spherical Bessel function routines, because Matlab does not have them, and a collection of routines for different variations of Legendre polynomials and derivatives that are needed for computing spherical wave functions. Finally, miscellaneous routines include things like FFT frequency generation, vectorized solutions for cubic and quartic roots, and simple ways for generating points on a sphere.
